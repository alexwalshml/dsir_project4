## Problem Statement

Credit card fraud is a growing problem in our society as more and more transactions are conducted online and digitally. The annual cost of credit card fraud is estimated to be in the billions of dollars, and it not only results in financial losses for individuals, but also undermines trust in the banking system. With the shift towards cashless transactions, it is more important than ever to improve fraud detection to protect consumers from identity theft, unauthorized transactions, and financial losses. In this project, we aim to develop a classification model using simulated credit card fraud data to detect fraudulent transactions and reduce these losses. By effectively detecting and preventing credit card fraud, we can help build a more secure and trustworthy financial system for all Americans.

## Executive Summary

In this project, we aimed to improve the detection of credit card fraud, a growing problem in our society as more and more transactions are conducted online and digitally. The annual cost of credit card fraud is estimated to be in the billions of dollars, and it not only results in financial losses for individuals, but also undermines trust in the banking system. We used a simulation-generated data set to train and build a fraud detection model to protect consumers. We analyzed the data to identify meaningful trends that were related to predicting fraudulent activity. We built several classification models to evaluate their performance and address the challenges of highly imbalanced classes. To improve the performance of our models, we engineered several features and transformed the data when applicable. After thoroughly evaluating various models, we found that the Random Forest algorithm performed the best with a nearly 99% accuracy and only 2% false negative predictions. Given the effectiveness of our model, we strongly recommend implementing the model  in order to reduce future fraud and protect consumers.

#### Repository File Structure

The file structure below outlines what files are in which folders of this repository. The script to combine the simulation listed in the notebooks below will combine the 60 CSVs generated by the simulation tool used to generate the data for our project. We did not upload the 60 CSVs to this repository to preserve storage. Therefore, to get the 60 CSVs containing the data for this project, one would need to download and run the simulation from this repository: https://github.com/namebrandon/Sparkov_Data_Generation
